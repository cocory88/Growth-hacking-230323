SQL Aliases
SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name.

# Alias Column Syntax
SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;

# Alias Table Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name AS alias_name;


Exercise:
When displaying the Customers table, make an ALIAS of the PostalCode column, the column should be called Pno instead.

SELECT CustomerName,
Address,
PostalCode 
FROM Customers AS Pno;


Exercise:
When displaying the Customers table, refer to the table as Consumers instead of Customers.

SELECT *
FROM Customers AS Consumers;
