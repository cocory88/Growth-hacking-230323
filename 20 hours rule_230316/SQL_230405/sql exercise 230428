SQL JOIN
A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

Different Types of SQL JOINs
Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:

(INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table


INNER JOIN  
LEFT JOIN  
RIGHT JOIN  
FULL OUTER JOIN


Exercise:
Insert the missing parts in the JOIN clause to join the two tables Orders and Customers, using the CustomerID field in both tables as the relationship between the two tables.


SELECT *
FROM Orders
LEFT JOIN Customers
ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;


Exercise:
Choose the correct JOIN clause to select all records from the two tables where there is a match in both tables.
